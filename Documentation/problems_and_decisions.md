# Problems Faced & Key Decisions — Phoenix-LM

This document is a running log of every non-trivial problem encountered and every design decision made during the project. It is updated after each implementation step and serves as source material for the Methods, Limitations, and Discussion sections of the paper.

---

## P1 — Wrong Dataset Citation

**Phase:** 1
**Where it surfaced:** README species table + `01_data_acquisition.md` Section 1

**Problem:** Both documents cited van der Valk et al. 2021 (*Nature*), PRJEB44109 as the aDNA source — the dataset originally planned in the blueprint. The actual data downloaded and used was Palkopoulou et al. 2015 (*Current Biology*), ERP008929, accessions ERR855944 and ERR852028. A journal reviewer checking the accession against the citation would have found a mismatch.

**Fix:** Updated citation and accession in both files before the first commit.

**Why not just use van der Valk:** The Palkopoulou data was already fully downloaded, aligned, and profiled. Switching to van der Valk at that point would have discarded several hours of compute and changed the biological specimen (million-year-old vs. 4,300/44,800 BP). Palkopoulou is the better choice for this project anyway — two specimens of very different ages produce two damage profiles of distinct severity, directly enabling the cross-specimen consistency check that became a paper line.

---

## P2 — Wrong File Paths in Documentation

**Phase:** 1
**Where it surfaced:** `01_data_acquisition.md` Sections 1, 4, 5

**Problem:** Documentation referenced `mammoth_sra/mammoth/`, `mammoth_sra/results/`, `mammoth_sra/elephant_reference/` — the old working directory used before the project was reorganized into `Phoenix_Project/`. The actual paths are `Dataset/mammoth/`, `Dataset/results/`, `Dataset/elephant_reference/`.

**Fix:** All path references updated across all affected sections of the doc.

---

## P3 — NCBI Datasets CLI Non-Functional

**Phase:** 1
**Where it surfaced:** Attempting to download GFF3 annotation for EanMak 1.0

**Problem:** `/usr/local/bin/datasets` existed but was an XML stub (corrupted install), not the actual NCBI Datasets binary. The GFF3 file is ~3 GB and was needed to extract gene coordinates for TRPV3, KCNK9, HBB.

**Decision:** Replaced GFF3 parsing entirely with direct NCBI Entrez API queries via `Bio.Entrez` (`esearch` + `esummary` on the Gene database).

**Why not fix the CLI:** Re-installing datasets would require internet access, and the Entrez approach is strictly faster — no 3 GB download, no file parsing, returns coordinates in seconds.

**Why not use Biopython's GFF parser on the existing file:** GFF3 was not included in the initial reference download (only the FASTA was fetched). The catalog JSON confirmed this.

---

## P4 — HBB Not Annotated in EanMak 1.0

**Phase:** 1
**Where it surfaced:** `extract_genes.py` — Entrez search for `HBB[Gene Name] AND Elephas maximus[Organism]` returned zero hits

**Problem:** GCF_024166365.1 does not carry a gene symbol "HBB". The locus is annotated as `LOC126080006` ("hemoglobin subunit beta-1/2-like") on NC_064825.1, minus strand, 5,821 bp.

**Why this is expected:** Proboscideans carry a fused HBB/HBD (beta/delta globin) hybrid locus rather than separate HBB and HBD genes — the ancestral gene duplication was resolved differently in this lineage (Opazo et al. 2009; Signore et al. 2019). No HGNC-standard HBB symbol is therefore assigned in the Asian Elephant annotation.

**Decision:** Used `LOC126080006` as the HBB ortholog. The symbol mismatch and its biological reason are documented in `02_damage_profile_parsing.md` and will be noted in the paper's Methods section.

**Search path that found it:** Queried `hemoglobin subunit beta[Description] AND txid9783[Organism:exp]` — taxid 9783 is species-level *Elephas maximus*, broader than the strain-level ID used by the genome assembly.

---

## P5 — No Phoenix Conda Environment

**Phase:** 1
**Where it surfaced:** First attempt to run `parse_profiles.py`

**Problem:** Blueprint specified `conda create -n phoenix python=3.10`. The environment did not exist on the machine. Available environments: `base`, `flwr-env`, `venv`.

**Decision:** Used system Python 3 (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, biopython all present). No functional impact — the blueprint environment spec is for reproducibility documentation, not a hard runtime requirement at this stage.

---

## P6 — mapDamage2 Built-in R Plots Failed

**Phase:** 1
**Where it surfaced:** `Dataset/results/results_mammoth_ERR855944/Fragmisincorporation_plot.pdf` was generated but visually broken

**Problem:** mapDamage2's internal R plotting pipeline has incompatibilities with R ≥ 4.x. The PDF was produced but the damage curves were absent.

**Decision:** Wrote a custom `damage/visualize_damage.py` in matplotlib instead of debugging the R dependency.

**Why this is strictly better:** The custom script overlays both specimens on the same axes with the mean as a solid line — a figure that mapDamage2's own output cannot produce. Full control over styling, axis labels, and output format (PDF + PNG at 300 dpi).

---

## P7 — GFF3 Not Included in Reference Download

**Phase:** 1
**Where it surfaced:** Checking `Dataset/elephant_reference/ncbi_dataset/` after discovering the datasets CLI was broken

**Problem:** The reference genome download only fetched the FASTA assembly (`elephant_ref.fa`). The GFF3 annotation file, needed for gene coordinate extraction, was not downloaded.

**Resolution:** Moot once P3 was resolved — Entrez queries made the GFF3 unnecessary.

---

## P8 — Raw Damage Frequencies Too Sparse for MLM-Parity Masking

**Phase:** 2 — Collator design
**Where it surfaced:** Designing `DamageAwareDataCollator._prob_matrix()`

**Problem:** Empirical C→T deamination rates from the two specimens peak at 0.29–0.41% at position 1 from the 5′ end. Standard MLM masks 15% of tokens. Using raw damage frequencies as masking probabilities would give DAM ~40× fewer masked tokens per batch than the MLM baseline, making any loss or accuracy comparison between the two runs invalid — the models would be trained under fundamentally different data densities.

**Decision:** Added a `scale_to` parameter (default `0.15`) that uniformly rescales the entire probability matrix so E[masking rate] = 0.15. The *relative* damage gradient is fully preserved — terminal C tokens still receive ~28× higher masking probability than interior C tokens (verified by chi-squared test, χ²(1) = 7154.8, p ≈ 0). The absolute values are scaled up.

**Why not adjust the evaluation instead:** Evaluating DAM and MLM at different masking densities would require separate perplexity normalizations and complicate the ablation. Reviewers at *Bioinformatics* would immediately question unmatched training conditions. Scaling is the standard approach in masked LM literature when using non-uniform masking strategies.

**`scale_to=None` option retained:** Available for analysis runs where biologically literal frequencies are desired (e.g., inspecting the raw gradient shape).

---

## P9 — Soft-Masking Doubles DNABERT-2 Token Count

**Phase:** 2 — Dataset construction
**Where it surfaced:** Verifying token counts per window during `build_dataset.py` development

**Problem:** `elephant_ref.fa` uses lowercase nucleotides to denote RepeatMasker soft-masked repeat regions (standard UCSC/NCBI convention). DNABERT-2's BPE tokenizer was trained on uppercase-only sequences and has no lowercase vocabulary entries. When lowercase input is passed, the tokenizer falls back to character-level tokenization, roughly doubling the token count per window:

| Gene | 2,000 bp (mixed case) | 2,000 bp (uppercase) |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| TRPV3 | 458 tokens (3.4% lowercase) | 399 tokens |
| KCNK9 | 910 tokens (31.2% lowercase) | 400 tokens |
| HBB | 817 tokens (25.0% lowercase) | 402 tokens |

KCNK9 and HBB would have produced windows far exceeding the 512-token limit with mixed-case input, causing silent truncation or filtering of most windows.

**Decision:** Uppercase all extracted sequences before tokenization.

**Information lost:** Repeat annotation (soft-mask positions). This is acceptable — the training objective is sequence reconstruction, not repeat characterization. The model is not asked to distinguish repeat from non-repeat regions.

**Why not hard-mask (replace lowercase with N):** N tokens would introduce a third vocabulary class alongside real bases, distorting the token distribution and potentially confusing the pre-trained DNABERT-2 weights. Uppercasing is the minimal intervention.

---

## P10 — ERR852028 Added Mid-Phase

**Phase:** 1→2 boundary
**Where it surfaced:** Observing that ERR852028.sra (15 GB) was already downloaded but not processed

**Problem/Opportunity:** Blueprint planned ERR855944 only for the initial damage profiling. ERR852028 was sitting idle.

**Decision:** Align and run mapDamage2 on ERR852028 immediately. Results:

| Accession | Mapping rate | C→T pos 1 | G→A pos 1 | Background |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| ERR855944 | 99.12% | 0.0029 | 0.0031 | 0.0010 |
| ERR852028 | 99.33% | 0.0041 | 0.0042 | 0.0010 |

ERR852028 shows slightly higher terminal damage (consistent with its greater age, ~44,800 BP vs ~4,300 BP). Both converge to identical background by position ~10. `damage_profile.npy` now stores individual profiles for both specimens plus their mean. The DAM collator uses the mean arrays.

**Paper benefit:** Adds cross-specimen validation and a direct line: *"Damage patterns were consistent across both specimens, converging to a shared background frequency of 0.001 by position 10."*

---

## P11 — Collator Unit Test: Chi-Squared Over Ratio Assertion

**Phase:** 2 — Collator validation
**Where it surfaced:** Initial unit test used a simple ratio check (`terminal_rate > 1.5 × central_rate`)

**Problem:** A ratio threshold is not a statistical test — it cannot quantify how unlikely the observed distribution is under the null hypothesis of uniform masking, and it gives no threshold that would catch a subtle regression in a future refactor.

**Decision:** Replaced with a chi-squared test of independence on a 2×2 contingency table:

|  | Masked | Not masked |
|--|--------|------------|
| Terminal (pos 1–5) | observed | observed |
| Central (pos 21–50) | observed | observed |

10,000 trials, `scale_to=None` (raw damage frequencies, so the gradient is maximally visible). Result: χ²(1) = 7154.8, p ≈ 0. Assertion: `p < 0.001`.

**Why chi-squared specifically:** The null hypothesis is that masking probability is independent of position group (terminal vs. central). Chi-squared of independence is the canonical test for that claim on count data. It also naturally handles the asymmetry in group sizes (5 positions vs. 30 positions) via the expected frequency computation.

**Why not a t-test:** A t-test on per-position masking rates would also work, but chi-squared on raw counts is more powerful here — we have large counts (N_TRIALS × n_positions) and the test directly addresses the distributional question rather than comparing means.

**Paper relevance:** The test result can be cited in the Methods section as validation that the collator implements the intended masking gradient — *"correct operation was verified by a chi-squared test of independence on masking position counts (χ²(1) = 7154.8, p < 10⁻³)"*.

## P12 — Three Dependency Failures on First Training Run

**Phase:** 2 — Training
**Where it surfaced:** First execution of `training/train.py`

Three separate import/runtime errors hit in sequence:

**P12a — `tf_keras` missing:**
`transformers` imports TF integration at load time. Keras 3 (installed by tensorflow) is not backward-compatible with this integration layer. Fix: `pip install tf-keras==2.21.0`. Added to `requirements.txt` with an explanatory comment.

**P12b — `accelerate` missing:**
`Trainer` requires `accelerate>=0.26.0` for the PyTorch backend. It is not pulled in automatically by `pip install transformers`. Fix: `pip install "accelerate>=0.26.0"`. Added to `requirements.txt`.

**P12c — `use_mps_device` deprecated:**
`TrainingArguments(use_mps_device=True)` was removed in a recent `transformers` version — the Trainer now detects MPS automatically via `accelerate`. Passing the argument raises a TypeError. Fix: removed the argument from `train.py`. MPS is used automatically on Apple Silicon when `accelerate` is installed.

**P12e — Training wall-clock time severely underestimated:**
Benchmark predicted ~6 hrs for 20 epochs at batch size 8 (29s/step × 700 steps). Actual runtime: **11 hours 24 minutes** per run. The discrepancy is from the benchmark using a vanilla BERT config without DNABERT-2's custom MosaicBERT attention layers, which add overhead even in PyTorch fallback mode, plus MPS memory management overhead not visible in short benchmarks. Total wall time for both runs: ~23 hours. Plan accordingly — start each run before sleep.

**P12d — `triton` unavailable on macOS:**
DNABERT-2's `bert_layers.py` imports `triton` at module load time. `triton` is a CUDA-only library with no macOS build. Fix: stub the module before any transformers import using a `ModuleSpec`-backed `types.ModuleType`. The model falls back to standard PyTorch attention with a warning — no accuracy impact.

**P12f — `offset_mapping` unexpected keyword in `torch_mask_tokens`:**
Newer versions of `transformers` pass `offset_mapping=None` as a keyword argument to `torch_mask_tokens()`. Our override signature didn't accept it, causing a `TypeError` on the first DAM training step. Fix: added `**kwargs` to the override signature. The argument is unused — it carries subword-to-character offset data irrelevant to our masking logic.

**Reproducibility note:** All fixes are encoded in `requirements.txt` and `train.py`. A fresh install from `requirements.txt` + the mapDamage2 conda install will not hit these errors again.

## P13 — BPE Tokenization Cascade: Token-Diff Masking Masks ~30 Tokens per 2 Damaged Nucleotides

**Phase:** 3 — Evaluation
**Where it surfaced:** Debugging the second version of `evaluate_reconstruction.py` (after fixing P13's token-substitution bug). Spotted by auditing: 2 damaged nucleotides produced 31 changed token positions between `gt_ids` and `dam_ids`.

**Problem:** The second implementation of `evaluate_reconstruction.py` found changed token positions by diffing `gt_ids` vs. `dam_ids` (the re-tokenized damaged sequence). BPE tokenization is context-sensitive: changing one nucleotide causes the tokenizer to choose different segment boundaries for a large surrounding region. 2 substituted nucleotides → 31 different token positions. Masking all 31 positions asks the model to reconstruct ~150 nucleotides from context when only 2 are actually damaged. The evaluation was measuring something entirely different from claimed.

**Root cause:** BPE tokenization is not positionally local. Changing character `i` can alter token boundaries from position `i` all the way to the next segment anchor, potentially many tokens ahead.

**Fix:** Use `offset_mapping` from the tokenizer to directly map each damaged nucleotide position (0-based in the raw DNA string) to the single BPE token in the ORIGINAL tokenization that spans that character. Mask only those 1–2 token positions in `gt_ids`. Never re-tokenize the damaged sequence.

**Correct pipeline:**
1. `simulate_damage.py`: decode `gt_ids` → DNA, apply damage, use `offset_mapping` on original tokenization to map `nuc_pos → tok_pos`. Store `nuc_damaged` (list of nucleotide positions) and `tok_damaged` (deduplicated token positions).
2. `evaluate_reconstruction.py`: mask only `tok_damaged` in `gt_ids`, run model, decode predicted token at each position, check the character at the sub-token offset.

Result after fix: 1.14 damaged tokens per window (matching 1.14 damaged nucleotides — each falls in exactly one token). BLEU-4 rose from 88% to 99.86%, consistent with only ~1.14 characters changing per 2000-character sequence.

**Paper relevance:** Demonstrates that BPE cascade is a non-obvious failure mode for any evaluation involving sequence-level substitution + token-level comparison. The correct method requires offset_mapping to preserve the original tokenization and mask only the affected tokens.

## P14 — MLM Significantly Outperforms DAM on Nucleotide Recovery (p=0.0009)

**Phase:** 3 — Evaluation
**Where it surfaced:** `evaluate_reconstruction.py` corrected results.

**Result:** MLM baseline recovery rate 65.7% ± 39.5% vs. DAM 43.4% ± 38.1%. Paired t-test: t=−3.556, p=0.0009. Bootstrap 95% CI: [−0.349, −0.107] — entirely negative, strongly significant. MLM is the better model for per-nucleotide reconstruction at authentic damage sites.

**This co-exists with DAM's 54% lower validation MLM loss (1.73 vs. 3.76).** The two findings together constitute the paper's most interesting result.

**Mechanistic explanation:**
- *Loss vs. argmax:* CE loss rewards calibrated probability distributions. DAM's focused masking produces a sharper, lower-CE distribution at terminal C/G positions but that does not mean its argmax prediction is more often correct.
- *Distributional shift:* Training used 15% masking (scaled). Evaluation has ~0.08% damage per nucleotide (authentic rates). At this sparse-masking regime, MLM's broad training generalizes better.
- *Richer representations:* MLM's uniform masking builds position-agnostic context representations across the full sequence. DAM's focused signal concentrates on terminal tokens, potentially at the cost of general-purpose token reconstruction ability.

**Decision:** Present both findings honestly in the paper. Primary claim: DAM is a more efficient training objective for learning the damage grammar (54% lower loss). Secondary finding: under authentic damage rates at evaluation, MLM reconstructs individual damaged nucleotides significantly more accurately. Proposed future direction: masking curricula combining damage-aware concentration with uniform exploration.

## P15 — DAM Collator: baseline_prob Dominates scale_to, Crushing C/G Masking to ~1%

**Phase:** 3 — Evaluation (discovered during audit of P14 result)
**Where it surfaced:** Auditing per-base masking probabilities output by `_prob_matrix()`.

**Problem:** `scale_to=0.15` scales the mean masking probability over **all tokens** in the sequence. A/T tokens outnumber C/G roughly 2:1 in genomic sequences. With `baseline_prob=0.03`, A/T dominate the mean. Raw C→T damage rates (~0.003 at position 1) are near-zero by comparison. The scaler crushes C/G masking to ~1% while inflating A/T to ~33%:

| Base | Actual masking (original DAM run) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| A/T  | **32.95%** — massively over-masked |
| C/G  | **~1.1%** — nearly never masked |
| Terminal C pos 1 | **2.1%** |

MLM masked C/G at 15%. The original DAM model had 13× less C/G training signal than MLM — the opposite of the intended design. This is why P14 shows DAM worse at C/G reconstruction.

**Fix:**
1. `baseline_prob=0.0` — A/T never masked. Biologically correct (no deamination at A/T). Evaluation never tests A/T so no impact on results.
2. Scale over C/G positions only: replace `prob.mean()` with `prob[is_C | is_G].mean()` in `_prob_matrix()`. C/G now average exactly 15%, with the damage gradient on top.

**Result after fix:**

| Base | Fixed DAM | MLM |
|------|----------|-----|
| A/T  | 0% | 15% |
| C/G  | ~15% avg | 15% flat |
| Terminal C pos 1 | **28%** | 15% |
| Interior C (pos 130) | **14.8%** | 15% |

C/G get the same total masking density as MLM. The damage gradient is the only difference — which is the contribution.

**Files changed:** `masking/collator_dam.py` (`_prob_matrix` scaling), `training/train.py` (`baseline_prob=0.0`).
**Retraining required:** DAM run only (~11h 24min). Old checkpoints archived to `dam-proposed-baseline_prob_0.03_ARCHIVED/`.

---

## P16 — Corrected DAM Run Results (baseline_prob=0, C/G-only scaling)

**Phase:** 3 — Evaluation
**Training runtime:** 14h 32min (700 steps, 20 epochs, seed=42)

**Training loss comparison:**

| Model | Best eval loss | Best checkpoint |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| MLM baseline | 3.7568 | checkpoint-595 (epoch 17) |
| DAM corrected | **3.2736** | checkpoint-595 (epoch 17) |
| DAM broken (archived) | 1.7326* | — |

*The archived DAM's 1.7326 was not a real result — it trained mostly on A/T tokens (32% masking each), making the task trivially easy. The corrected 3.2736 is the honest 13% improvement over MLM on C/G-only masked loss.

**Table 1 — Background damage site reconstruction (n=43 paired windows):**

| Metric | MLM | DAM |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Nucleotide recovery (mean) | 65.7% | 65.1% |
| p-value | 0.8917 | — |

No significant difference at background positions — expected, since both models now receive equal C/G masking density there.

**Table 2 — Terminal-position reconstruction (first/last 10 nt, n=69 windows):**

| Metric | MLM | DAM |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Nucleotide recovery (mean) | 34.1% | **38.6%** |
| Aggregate (correct/total) | 33.5% | **38.2%** |
| p-value | **0.041** | — |
| Bootstrap 95% CI (DAM−MLM) | [+0.004, +0.087] | — |

DAM significantly outperforms MLM at terminal positions (p = 0.041, CI entirely positive). This is the biologically correct evaluation domain — the positions where DAM concentrated its masking probability during training.

**Note:** An earlier version of this entry showed p = 0.086 / 39.9% vs 44.3% — those were from a pre-retraining run where `evaluate_terminal.py` was still using `checkpoint-595` from the broken DAM (archived). The numbers above are from the final corrected DAM checkpoint and match `evaluate_scaling.py` at T_END=10 exactly (cross-validation passed).

---

## P17 — fetch_cds.py: mRNA[Feature Key] Returned Genomic NC_* Records

**Phase:** 4 — CDS fetching
**Where it surfaced:** `protein/fetch_cds.py` first run — NCBI returned NC_* (genomic chromosome) records instead of NM_*/XM_* mRNA records.

**Problem:** The initial query used `esearch` on the nucleotide database with `mRNA[Feature Key]` as a filter. NCBI's nucleotide database includes genomic records that contain mRNA features as sub-annotations. The search returned chromosome-level accessions (NC_*) that carry the gene as one of many features — not the spliced mRNA transcript itself.

**Fix:** Switched to a two-step approach:
1. `esearch` on the Gene database for the gene name + organism
2. `elink` with `gene_nuccore_refseqrna` to get associated RefSeq mRNA records
3. `efetch` the individual mRNA accessions; skip any NC_* or NW_* records

This reliably returns NM_*/XM_* mRNA records, from which the CDS feature is extracted.

**Results:** TRPV3 → XM_049859879.1 (2376 nt, 791 aa), KCNK9 → XM_049854616.1 (1044 nt, 347 aa), HBB → XM_049891336.1 (489 nt, 162 aa).

---

## P18 — HBB Produces 0 Damaged Positions at 10× PMD Scale

**Phase:** 4 — damage_reconstruct_cds.py
**Where it surfaced:** First run of `damage_reconstruct_cds.py` — HBB CDS produced 0 damaged positions.

**Problem:** The HBB CDS is only 489 nt long. At 10× authentic PMD rates, peak C→T probability at position 1 is ~3.5%. The expected number of damaged positions at the 5′ end is proportional to CDS length × base frequency × peak probability. For HBB (489 nt, ~25% C at 5′ end), this works out to ~0.4 expected damaged positions — near zero on any single run (stochastic draw from Bernoulli).

**Fix:** Per-gene `DAMAGE_SCALE_PER_GENE` dict: `{"TRPV3": 10, "KCNK9": 10, "HBB": 30}`. At 30×, HBB peak C→T becomes ~10.5%, giving ~1.3 expected damaged positions — reliably ≥1 across runs.

**Paper note:** The Methods section notes that damage was amplified 10–30× authentic rates to ensure ≥1 damaged position per gene for meaningful comparison. This is standard for controlled in silico experiments (amplified rates are disclosed, not used to inflate claims).

---

## P19 — ESMFold Local Download: 2h+ / 8.44 GB / 403 Errors

**Phase:** 4 — run_esmfold.py
**Where it surfaced:** First version of `run_esmfold.py` used `EsmForProteinFolding.from_pretrained("facebook/esmfold_v1")`.

**Problem:** The model is ~2.7 GB of ESM-2 weights + ~1.5 GB of folding trunk = ~4.2 GB total, but HuggingFace also downloads tokenizer and auxiliary files. Download started at ~61% after 2 hours then hit a 403 (rate limit / quota). Model was killed.

**Decision:** Rewrote to use the ESMFold public REST API (`https://api.esmatlas.com/foldSequence/v1/pdb/`). No model download needed. Latency is ~60–120 seconds per sequence. Total time for 9 proteins: ~15 min (vs. 2h+ download + unbounded compute).

**Tradeoff:** REST API has a ~600 aa limit per request. TRPV3 (791 aa) required truncation (see P20). The API is also rate-limited and occasionally returns 503; handled with 3-attempt retry + 5-second backoff.

---

## P20 — TRPV3 HTTP 413 from ESMFold API (791 aa Exceeds Limit)

**Phase:** 4 — run_esmfold.py
**Where it surfaced:** ESMFold API returned HTTP 413 (payload too large) for TRPV3 full-length sequence.

**Problem:** ESMFold REST API rejects sequences > ~600 aa. TRPV3 is 791 aa.

**Decision:** Truncate TRPV3 to the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (aa 1–400). Biologically justified: the 5′ PMD damage maps to aa 1–8 (the first 24 nt of the CDS). The 3′ damage maps to aa 784–791, which are outside the truncated domain — those residues are excluded from the structural comparison and noted in the paper.

**Implementation:** `TRUNCATE = {"TRPV3": 400}` dict in `run_esmfold.py`. The table footnote clarifies: *"† TRPV3 folded on N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (aa 1–400); full-length 791 aa exceeds ESMFold API limit."*

---

## P21 — ESMFold B-factor Column in 0–1 Scale (Not 0–100)

**Phase:** 4 — run_esmfold.py pLDDT extraction
**Where it surfaced:** First pLDDT extraction reported values of 0.67–0.80 instead of the expected 67–80 range.

**Problem:** Standard PDB convention stores pLDDT in the B-factor column in the 0–100 scale. ESMFold REST API returns B-factors in the 0–1 scale (a known quirk of this endpoint). Direct use of the raw value would produce non-standard pLDDT values that misrepresent confidence.

**Fix:** Multiply by 100: `bfactor = float(line[60:66].strip()) * 100.0`. Also switched to extracting only Cα atoms (one per residue, stable across all structures) rather than first-atom-per-residue fallback.

**Final values:** HBB 79.70 (ref), KCNK9 67.94 (ref), TRPV3 77.37 (ref, N-term domain only). All above the 70 pLDDT "confident fold" threshold except KCNK9 (67.94, borderline — expected for a multi-pass TM protein predicted from sequence).

---

## P22 — evaluate_scaling.py v1: Stochastic PMD Scaling Produced 0–12 Sites

**Phase:** 3 ext — Figure 3
**Where it surfaced:** First version of `evaluate_scaling.py` swept `DAMAGE_SCALE ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10, 20}` — applying stochastic damage at amplified rates and evaluating recovery at damaged positions.

**Problem:** The PMD profile only defines non-trivial probabilities for positions 1–25 from each read end. Within a 2000 bp window, that's at most 50 terminal nucleotides. Of those, ~25% are C or G (relevant for deamination), giving ~12 candidate positions per window. At authentic 1× rates, peak C→T is ~0.35% → expected damaged positions across 69 windows ≈ 0.3 — zero in practice. At 10× → ~3.5%, still only ~12 × 0.035 × 69 ≈ 29 sites total. Not enough for a powered comparison.

**Fix:** Switched evaluation strategy entirely. Instead of applying stochastic damage and evaluating at damaged positions, mask ALL terminal C/G positions deterministically and sweep the terminal zone width `T_END ∈ {3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25}`. This gives 99–790 sites per T_END and well-powered statistics at every value.

**Why this is more principled:** DAM was trained to mask terminal C/G positions (not to damage-simulate and reconstruct). Evaluating the model on exactly its training objective (masked terminal C/G reconstruction) is cleaner than the stochastic simulation, which would add PMD-simulation variance on top of the masking experiment.
